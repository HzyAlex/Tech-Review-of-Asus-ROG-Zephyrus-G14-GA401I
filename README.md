## Price
Due to the manufacturing progress, the price is unknown for Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 GA401I. However, base on the configuration, the price probably will locate in a range of 1300$ to 1400$.

## Design
The Zephyrus G14 - GA401 Gaming Laptop looks amazing. The Zephyrus G14 may be a completely new design and not supported the prevailing Zephyrus G 15 chassis, unlike the 2020 GA502I, which is usually a hardware refresh of the previous GA502DU generation.  

With a 14-inch screen and fairly compact form-factor, it’s designed to be more portable than the prevailing 15-inch gaming notebooks, but without sacrificing on usability and performance.  
Magnesium-aluminum alloys are used for the most chassis, with a premium feel and therefore the same fingerprint resistance shown by the higher-tier Zephyrus M and S lineups. rock bottom remains plastic, and therefore the top is formed out of aluminum.

Asus offers a choice of either darker (Space Gray) or lighter (Mirage White) colors. i might normally lean towards the White model, it's neat and therefore the White lid does a far better job at hiding smudges, on the other hand this also gets a Silver keyboard, and white-backlit silver keys are a pain to affect thanks to their poor contrast. Hence, the Space Gray would be my choice between the 2.

The whole design process behind this technology was complex, the matrix including the layer of LEDs, the diffusion layer and a protection film to stop dust and dirt from getting inside, and engineers having to evenly spread the lighting across the whole array, while accounting for thermal and power constraints.
